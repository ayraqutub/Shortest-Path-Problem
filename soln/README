Running Instructions: 
	In the /soln directory, use the command "g++ -o <name_of_choice> server.cpp" to compile and link the .cpp file. Run the executable using  "./<name_of_choice>". 

Notes and Assumptions: 
    -if ID is taken it is unique
    -for edged defined by IDs, IDs are initialized in a vertex description line
    
    -Lines take the following forms:
		- a line of form V, ID, Lat, Lon (describing a vertex)
			- 'V' is the single character 'V', ID is an integer that is the vertex identifer (a label to it), Lat and Lon are floating point numbers related to the     geographic coordinates of this vertex.
  		- a line of form E, start, end, name (describing an edge/street)
			- 'E' is the single character 'E', star and end are teh Ids of the two vertieces connected by the edge, and the name is a nonempty string giving the name of this street.
